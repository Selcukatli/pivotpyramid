# Example Coaching Conversation

A sample dialogue showing how to guide a founder through pivot assessment using the Pivot Pyramid framework.

---

## Context

A founder of a B2B SaaS startup comes seeking help. They've been live for 8 months and are struggling with growth.

---

## The Conversation

### Opening

**Founder**: We've been struggling to grow for the past 6 months. We've tried different marketing channels but nothing seems to work. Should we pivot?

**Coach**: Let's diagnose what's actually happening before deciding. First, I want to understand your current configuration across the five layers of the Pivot Pyramid. Can you give me one sentence for each?

---

### Hypothesis Collection

**Founder**: Sure.

- **Customers**: We're building for small e-commerce stores, mostly on Shopify.
- **Problem**: They struggle with abandoned carts and lose a lot of revenue.
- **Solution**: We send automated cart recovery emails with AI-personalized discounts.
- **Technology**: We integrate with Shopify and use GPT for personalization.
- **Growth**: We've been trying Shopify App Store, content marketing, and some cold outreach.

**Coach**: Good start. Let me ask some clarifying questions. When you say "small e-commerce stores"—how specifically do you define that? Revenue range? Employee count?

**Founder**: Honestly, we take anyone who signs up. Probably stores doing $100K to $2M a year.

**Coach**: That's a wide range. A $100K store and a $2M store have very different needs and budgets. Do you notice different behavior between them?

**Founder**: Actually, yes. The smaller ones churn more. The ones around $1M+ seem to stick around longer.

---

### Evidence Assessment

**Coach**: Interesting. Let's assess evidence level for each layer. For your Customer layer—how confident are you that this is the right segment?

**Founder**: We have about 150 customers, but I'd say only 30% fit the $1M+ profile that sticks around.

**Coach**: So you have quantified evidence that a specific segment ($1M+) performs better. What about the Problem layer—abandoned carts losing revenue?

**Founder**: Everyone we talk to says it's a problem. They all have abandoned carts.

**Coach**: Do they describe it as a top-5 priority? Are they actively spending money on solutions?

**Founder**: Hmm. They acknowledge it when we bring it up, but I'm not sure they'd say it's top priority. Most seem more worried about traffic and customer acquisition.

**Coach**: That's an important signal. The problem may be real but not urgent—"nice to have" rather than "must have." What about your Solution—do customers describe it as dramatically better than alternatives?

**Founder**: Some do. But honestly, Klaviyo already does cart recovery, and they're everywhere. We're maybe 20% better on recovery rate.

**Coach**: 20% better is incremental, not 10x. That's a Solution layer warning sign.

---

### Identifying the Broken Layer

**Coach**: Let me summarize what I'm hearing:

| Layer | Evidence Level | Health Signal |
|-------|---------------|---------------|
| Customers | Quantified | Mixed—broad segment, but $1M+ subset works |
| Problem | Anecdotal | Weak—acknowledged but not urgent |
| Solution | Anecdotal | Weak—only 20% better than Klaviyo |
| Technology | Pattern | Seems fine—integration works |
| Growth | Anecdotal | Multiple channels tried, none working |

The symptom is "growth isn't working," but I don't think Growth is the broken layer. Let's trace bottom-up.

**Customer layer**: You have evidence that $1M+ stores work better. That's actually a good sign—you may have found your real customer segment.

**Problem layer**: This is concerning. Customers don't describe abandoned carts as urgent. They're more worried about traffic and acquisition.

**Solution layer**: Being 20% better than Klaviyo isn't enough to drive switching. You need to be 10x better on something.

**Founder**: So you think the problem is the Problem layer?

**Coach**: I think you're solving a "nice to have" problem, and your solution isn't differentiated enough. The combination makes growth nearly impossible. No amount of marketing optimization will overcome this.

---

### Checking for Anti-Patterns

**Coach**: Before we go further, let me check for some common traps. Are you trying to serve both the $100K stores and the $1M+ stores simultaneously?

**Founder**: Yes, we don't want to turn anyone away.

**Coach**: That's the Multi-Track Trap. You're essentially running two businesses—one for small stores that churn, one for larger stores that stick. Your product roadmap, messaging, and support are all split.

**Founder**: I hadn't thought of it that way.

**Coach**: And you've tried multiple marketing channels in the past 6 months—how long did you give each one?

**Founder**: Maybe 4-6 weeks each before moving on.

**Coach**: That's borderline Premature Pivot Syndrome on the growth layer. But in this case, I don't think the issue is how long you tested channels. The issue is the layers below.

---

### Diagnosis and Recommendation

**Coach**: Here's my diagnosis:

**Primary broken layer**: Problem
- Abandoned carts are not a "hair on fire" problem for your customers
- They care more about traffic and customer acquisition

**Secondary issue**: Solution
- 20% better than Klaviyo isn't enough differentiation
- You're competing with an established player on their turf

**Recommendation**: Problem Pivot

You should explore whether there's a more urgent problem you could solve for your $1M+ e-commerce customers. Something they'd describe as a top-3 priority.

**Founder**: Like what?

**Coach**: I don't know yet—that's what you need to discover. Go talk to 20 of your best customers (the $1M+ ones who stick around). Ask them:
- What's the most frustrating part of running your store?
- What keeps you up at night?
- What would you pay significant money to solve?

Listen for what they're already spending money on. Listen for workarounds and hacks they've built. That's where urgent problems hide.

---

### Next Steps

**Founder**: Okay. So I shouldn't try more growth experiments?

**Coach**: Not yet. Here's the sequence:

1. **Focus your customer**: Decide that $1M+ Shopify stores are your customer. Stop trying to serve everyone.

2. **Discover urgent problem**: Talk to 20+ customers in that segment. Find what they'd pay significant money to solve.

3. **Validate urgency**: For the problem you discover, run willingness tests. Will they talk? Will they show you their workflow? Will they pay for early access?

4. **Only then** think about solution and growth.

This is a Problem Pivot, which means your Solution, Technology, and Growth layers will all need to change. But start with validating the new problem before building anything.

**Founder**: How long should I give this?

**Coach**: 90 days for the discovery and validation phase. Document your hypothesis upfront. Set clear success criteria: "We'll consider this validated if 10 out of 20 customers describe this as a top-3 problem and 3 would pay for early access."

---

### Closing

**Founder**: This is really clarifying. I thought we had a marketing problem, but you're saying the problem is... the problem.

**Coach**: Exactly. The symptom showed up in Growth, but the root cause is in the Problem layer. Fix that first, and growth becomes much easier.

3. **Spotted anti-patterns**: Multi-Track Trap (serving two segments) and Premature Pivot Syndrome risk
4. **Recommended specific pivot type**: Problem Pivot
5. **Gave concrete next steps**: 20 customer conversations, specific questions, success criteria
6. **Applied 90-day rule**: Set timeline for validation phase
