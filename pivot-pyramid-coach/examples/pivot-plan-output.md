## PIVOT PLANNING DOCUMENT

**Date**: December 2024
**Company**: CartRecovery (fictional example)
**Author**: Founder/CEO
**Status**: Under Review

---

## Executive Summary

We are pivoting our Problem layer from "abandoned cart recovery" to "reducing wasted ad spend." Evidence shows that our current problem isn't urgent enough to drive adoption, while our $1M+ customer segment has strong pain around ad spend efficiency. This is a Problem Pivot that will cascade to Solution, Technology, and Growth layers.

---

## Current State

| Layer | Current Hypothesis |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Customers** | Small e-commerce stores on Shopify ($100K-$2M revenue) |
| **Problem** | They lose revenue from abandoned carts |
| **Solution** | AI-personalized cart recovery emails with dynamic discounts |
| **Technology** | Shopify integration + GPT-based personalization |
| **Growth** | Shopify App Store, content marketing, cold outreach |

### Evidence Summary (Current State)

| Layer | Evidence Level | Notes |
|-------|---------------|-------|
| Customers | Quantified | 150 customers, but only 30% ($1M+) have good retention |
| Problem | Anecdotal | Customers acknowledge but don't prioritize |
| Solution | Anecdotal | Only 20% better than Klaviyo—not enough differentiation |
| Technology | Pattern | Integration works, no major issues |
| Growth | Anecdotal | Multiple channels tried, none achieving CAC < LTV |

---

## Target State

| Layer | New Hypothesis |
|-------|---------------|
| **Customers** | Shopify stores with $1M-5M revenue (focused segment) |
| **Problem** | They waste 30%+ of ad spend on ineffective campaigns |
| **Solution** | AI-powered ad spend optimizer that identifies waste and reallocates budget |
| **Technology** | Google/Meta ad API integrations + ML models for spend optimization |
| **Growth** | Shopify App Store + "Free ad spend audit" content marketing |

## Cascade Analysis

**Primary Pivot**: Problem Layer

We're changing from:
> "E-commerce stores struggle with abandoned carts"

To:
> "E-commerce stores waste 30%+ of ad spend on ineffective campaigns"

### Required Changes

**Solution Layer** (Must change)
- **Old**: Cart recovery emails with AI personalization
- **New**: Ad spend optimization platform with waste identification
- **Effort**: 3-4 months of product development
- **Reason**: New problem requires fundamentally different solution

**Technology Layer** (Must change)
- **Old**: Shopify integration + email sending
- **New**: Google Ads API, Meta Ads API, ML models for spend analysis
- **Effort**: 2-3 months of engineering
- **Reason**: Different solution requires different technical capabilities

**Growth Layer** (Must change)
- **Old**: "Recover lost revenue from abandoned carts"
- **New**: "Stop wasting 30% of your ad budget"
- **Effort**: 2-4 weeks to revamp messaging and landing pages
- **Reason**: New value proposition needs new positioning

### What We're Keeping

**Customer Layer** (Stable with focus)
- Narrowing from $100K-$2M to $1M-5M
- We have evidence this segment retains better
- They have budget for ad optimization tools
- No cascade impact from this focus

---

## Evidence Base

Why we believe this pivot will work:

### Customer Segment Validation
- Our $1M+ customers have 3x better retention than smaller stores (Quantified)
- 45 customer interviews confirmed ad spend is top-3 priority (Pattern)
- Average $1M-5M store spends $5-20K/month on ads (Quantified)

### Problem Urgency Signals
- 18 of 20 customers mentioned ad spend frustration unprompted (Pattern)
- 12 customers showed us their ad dashboards (Willingness test passed)
- 8 customers said they'd pay for a tool that reduced waste (Pattern)
- Average customer estimates 25-40% of spend is wasted (Anecdotal)

### Solution Differentiation
- No dominant "ad waste identifier" for SMB e-commerce (Market gap)
- Enterprise tools (Adobe, Sprinklr) cost $10K+/month (Price gap)
- Our ML team has experience in ad optimization (Capability)

## Success Criteria

### Leading Indicators (Measure Weekly)

| Metric | Current | Target | Threshold |
|--------|---------|--------|-----------|
| Prospect response to new positioning | N/A | 80%+ positive | 60% minimum |
| Demo requests from landing page | 2/week | 10/week | 5/week |
| Pilot signups | 0 | 20 | 10 |
| Time to value (first insight) | N/A | <1 day | <3 days |

### Lagging Indicators (Measure at 90 Days)

| Metric | Current | Target | Threshold |
|--------|---------|--------|-----------|
| Paying customers | 0 | 30 | 15 |
| MRR | $0 | $15K | $7.5K |
| Retention (Month 1) | N/A | 90%+ | 80% |
| CAC | N/A | <$500 | <$800 |

### Kill Criteria

We will abandon this pivot if:
- After 60 days, <5 pilot signups
- After 90 days, <$5K MRR
- Retention falls below 70% in first month
- 3+ customers report no value from insights

### Representative Quotes

> "I know I'm wasting money on ads, but I don't know which campaigns to cut. I'd pay for something that just told me what to turn off."

> "Cart abandonment is a problem, but honestly my bigger issue is that I'm spending $15K/month on Facebook and have no idea if it's working."

> "If you could show me I'm wasting $3K/month and help me fix it, that's worth $300/month easily."
