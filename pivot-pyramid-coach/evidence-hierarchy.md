# Evidence Hierarchy

Framework for assessing confidence in your startup hypotheses.

## The Five Evidence Levels

| Level | Description | Confidence | Example |
|-------|-------------|------------|---------|
| **Assumed** | Belief without testing | Low | "We think small businesses need this" |
| **Anecdotal** | Few customer conversations | Low-Medium | "3 people said they'd pay" |
| **Pattern** | Consistent signal from many | Medium | "73% of interviewees mentioned this pain" |
| **Quantified** | Data at scale | Medium-High | "NPS 50+ from this segment" |
| **Validated** | Customers paid money | High | "$50K MRR from this segment" |

## Level Definitions

### Assumed (Low Confidence)

You believe something but haven't tested it.

**Characteristics:**
- Based on intuition, industry knowledge, or founder experience
- No direct customer feedback
- Often stated as fact but is actually hypothesis

**Examples:**
- "Small businesses need affordable email marketing"
- "Developers want better documentation tools"
- "Enterprises will pay premium for security"

**Action required**: Talk to 20+ potential customers to move to Anecdotal

---

### Anecdotal (Low-Medium Confidence)

You've heard something from a few customers.

**Characteristics:**
- Based on 3-10 customer conversations
- May be biased by who you talked to
- Could be coincidence, not pattern

**Examples:**
- "3 customers mentioned this pain point"
- "A few prospects said they'd pay for this"
- "One churned customer cited this reason"

**Action required**: Talk to 20+ more customers to look for patterns

---

### Pattern (Medium Confidence)

You consistently hear the same thing from many customers.

**Characteristics:**
- Based on 20+ customer conversations
- Same themes emerge repeatedly
- Multiple customer segments confirm

**Examples:**
- "73% of interviewees mentioned struggling with X"
- "8 out of 10 churned customers cited same reason"
- "Every enterprise prospect asks about security"

**Action required**: Quantify with data at scale or validate with payment

---

### Quantified (Medium-High Confidence)

You have data at scale showing this.

**Characteristics:**
- Based on 100+ data points
- Statistically significant
- Measurable and repeatable

**Examples:**
- "NPS score of 50+ from this segment"
- "30% conversion rate on this value prop"
- "Churn is 2% for this cohort vs 8% overall"

**Action required**: Validate with payment behavior

---

### Validated (High Confidence)

Customers have paid money proving this.

**Characteristics:**
- Revenue from this hypothesis
- Customers vote with wallets
- Retention demonstrates ongoing value

**Examples:**
- "$50K MRR from this customer segment"
- "80% of customers renew after first year"
- "CAC:LTV ratio of 1:5 for this channel"

**Action required**: Scale and defend

## Evidence Inventory Checklists

Use these checklists to assess evidence quality for each layer.

### Customer Evidence Inventory

- [ ] We have defined our ideal customer profile in writing
- [ ] We can identify 100+ potential customers by name
- [ ] We have interviewed 20+ customers in the past 90 days
- [ ] We know our customers' average budget for this problem
- [ ] We understand our customers' buying process and decision-makers
- [ ] We know where our customers congregate online and offline

**Scoring:**
- 0-2 checked: Assumed
- 3-4 checked: Anecdotal
- 5-6 checked: Pattern or higher

---

### Problem Evidence Inventory

- [ ] Customers describe this problem unprompted
- [ ] Customers are actively spending money/time on alternatives
- [ ] We can quantify the cost of this problem for our customers
- [ ] The problem occurs frequently enough to justify a solution
- [ ] Customers prioritize this over other problems they face
- [ ] We've validated urgency with "hair on fire" test

**Scoring:**
- 0-2 checked: Assumed
- 3-4 checked: Anecdotal
- 5-6 checked: Pattern or higher

---

### Solution Evidence Inventory

- [ ] Customers describe our solution as "10x better" than alternatives
- [ ] New customers achieve value within their first session/day/week
- [ ] Customers would be "very disappointed" if our product disappeared
- [ ] Our solution directly addresses the validated problem
- [ ] Customers recommend us without being asked
- [ ] We have quantified time-to-value

**Scoring:**
- 0-2 checked: Assumed
- 3-4 checked: Anecdotal
- 5-6 checked: Pattern or higher

---

### Technology Evidence Inventory

- [ ] Our technology enables the solution we've designed
- [ ] Our technology can scale to serve our target market
- [ ] Our technology creates defensible competitive advantage
- [ ] Our technical debt is manageable
- [ ] Our team has the skills to maintain and improve our technology
- [ ] Performance meets customer expectations

**Scoring:**
- 0-2 checked: Assumed
- 3-4 checked: Anecdotal
- 5-6 checked: Pattern or higher

---

### Growth Evidence Inventory

- [ ] We know our customer acquisition cost (CAC) by channel
- [ ] We know our customer lifetime value (LTV) and it exceeds CAC
- [ ] We have at least one scalable acquisition channel
- [ ] We have retention/engagement metrics indicating product-market fit
- [ ] We're experimenting with new channels regularly
- [ ] We have 90+ days of data on primary channel

**Scoring:**
- 0-2 checked: Assumed
- 3-4 checked: Anecdotal
- 5-6 checked: Pattern or higher

## Common Evidence Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Treating Assumptions as Facts

**Wrong**: "Our customers need this feature."
**Right**: "We believe our customers need this feature (Assumed). We need to validate with 20+ conversations."

### Mistake 2: Conflating Interest with Commitment

**Wrong**: "10 people said they'd pay, so the problem is validated."
**Right**: "10 people expressed interest (Anecdotal). We need to get actual payment commitments or deposits."

### Mistake 3: Small Sample Sizes

**Wrong**: "Our churn is low (3 customers renewed)."
**Right**: "With only 3 data points, we can't draw conclusions. This is Anecdotal at best."

### Mistake 4: Ignoring Negative Evidence

**Wrong**: Counting only positive signals
**Right**: Weighting both supporting and contradicting evidence

### Mistake 5: Outdated Evidence

**Wrong**: Relying on validation from 12+ months ago
**Right**: Re-validating hypotheses at least quarterly

## Evidence Assessment Template

Use this format to document evidence for each layer:

```
LAYER: [Name]

HYPOTHESIS: [One sentence]

EVIDENCE LEVEL: [Assumed / Anecdotal / Pattern / Quantified / Validated]

SUPPORTING EVIDENCE:
- [Specific evidence point 1]
- [Specific evidence point 2]
- [Specific evidence point 3]

CONTRADICTING EVIDENCE:
- [Counter-evidence if any]

OPEN QUESTIONS:
- [Question that could invalidate this hypothesis]
- [Question that could strengthen this hypothesis]

LAST VALIDATED: [Date]

NEXT VALIDATION: [Planned action to increase confidence]
```

## Willingness Tests

Three progressive tests to validate problem urgency:

### Level 1: Will they talk?
- Will they get on a 30-minute call?
- Do they engage when you describe the problem?
- Do they share their own experiences unprompted?

### Level 2: Will they show?
- Will they demo their current workflow?
- Will they introduce you to colleagues with same problem?
- Will they give you access to see the problem in action?

### Level 3: Will they pay?
- Will they put down a deposit?
- Will they sign a letter of intent?
- Will they pay for early access?

Each level increases evidence strength from Anecdotal toward Validated.
