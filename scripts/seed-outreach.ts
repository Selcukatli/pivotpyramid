    emailBody: `Hi Adeo,

Hope you're well!

As a fellow FI mentor, I wanted to share something I've been working on.

After my second startup Boostable, while I was investing and mentoring at 500 Startups, I developed a mental framework called the Pivot Pyramid to help startups think about how to pivot and experiment. It got picked up by VentureBeat and the 500 blog at the time.

Recently, I noticed the framework has been cited organically in several places — including on the Founders Institute blog (https://fi.co/insight/what-pivoting-is-when-to-pivot-and-how-to-pivot-effectively), which was a nice surprise.

So I decided to polish it into a proper framework and ebook. I'm also building an AI agent and canvas editor to help founders put the framework into practice.

The core idea: not all pivots are created equal. There's a hierarchy — Customer → Problem → Solution → Technology → Growth — and understanding where you are determines how to pivot effectively.

Given it's already resonating with the FI community, would you be open to exploring a more formal integration into the curriculum? Happy to share the draft and demo the tools.

Best,
Selcuk`,

The core idea: pivots aren't random. They follow a hierarchy — Customer → Problem → Solution → Technology → Growth — and understanding where you are determines how expensive and risky your pivot will be.

Given your work on The Cold Start Problem, I think there's natural overlap — especially around the Growth layer pivots.

I've been working on a framework I think complements your work on Blitzscaling — it's called the Pivot Pyramid.

The core idea: before you can blitzscale, you need to nail your foundation. The Pivot Pyramid provides a structured way to validate (or invalidate) each layer: Customer → Problem → Solution → Technology → Growth.

I think there's a natural narrative arc: Pivot Pyramid helps you find product-market fit, then Blitzscaling helps you scale it.

Would love to get your thoughts. If it resonates, I'd be honored to have your endorsement — or even explore a foreword.

After my second startup Boostable, while I was investing and mentoring at 500, I developed a mental framework called the Pivot Pyramid to help startups think about how to pivot and experiment. It got picked up by VentureBeat and the 500 blog at the time.

The Pivot Pyramid applies design thinking principles to startup strategy. It provides a structured hierarchy for understanding business model pivots: Customer → Problem → Solution → Technology → Growth.

Given the d.school's focus on human-centered design and creative problem-solving, I think this framework could complement your curriculum — especially for students tackling entrepreneurial challenges.

I read "Creative Acts for Curious People" and was inspired by your approach to structured creativity. The Pivot Pyramid aims to bring similar structure to the often chaotic process of pivoting a startup.

Your work on Customer Development fundamentally shaped how I build companies. I've developed a framework called the Pivot Pyramid that I believe extends your methodology.

After my second startup Boostable, while I was investing and mentoring at 500, I developed this mental framework to help startups think about how to pivot and experiment. It got picked up by VentureBeat and the 500 blog at the time. Recently, I noticed it's been cited organically in several places — Founders Institute, among others — so I decided to polish it into a proper framework and ebook.

Your work taught us that startups need to "get out of the building" and validate hypotheses. The Pivot Pyramid provides a structured hierarchy for what to do when that validation fails: Customer → Problem → Solution → Technology → Growth.

Key insight: Not all pivots are equal. A Customer pivot is fundamentally different (and more expensive) than a Solution pivot. The framework provides playbooks for each type.

I'm also building an AI agent and canvas editor to help founders put it into practice.

Would you be open to reviewing it? Your feedback would be invaluable — and if it resonates, I'd love to explore how it might complement Lean LaunchPad.
