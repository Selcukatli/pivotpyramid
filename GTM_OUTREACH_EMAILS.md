# Pivot Pyramid GTM Outreach Emails

**From:** Selcuk Atli (YC W14, 500 Startups Venture Partner, Founder of Bunch)
**Product:** Pivot Pyramid Ebook & Canvas Tool
**Date:** December 2025

## Background (Use in emails as needed)

After my second startup Boostable, while I was investing and mentoring at 500 Startups, I developed a mental framework called the **Pivot Pyramid** to help startups think about how to pivot and experiment. It got picked up by VentureBeat and the 500 blog at the time.

Recently, I realized many blogs and publications have picked up on the idea and cited it organically — including Founders Institute, among others.

So I decided to polish it into a proper framework and put together a draft for an ebook. I'm also building an AI agent and canvas editor to help founders put the ebook into practice.

**Email:** adeo@founderinstitute.com
**Relationship:** You're a mentor at Founders Institute

**Subject:** Pivot Pyramid — already featured on FI blog

Hi Adeo,

Hope you're well!

As a fellow FI mentor, I wanted to share something I've been working on.

After my second startup Boostable, while I was investing and mentoring at 500 Startups, I developed a mental framework called the **Pivot Pyramid** to help startups think about how to pivot and experiment. It got picked up by VentureBeat and the 500 blog at the time.

Recently, I noticed the framework has been cited organically in several places — including on the [Founders Institute blog](https://fi.co/insight/what-pivoting-is-when-to-pivot-and-how-to-pivot-effectively), which was a nice surprise.

So I decided to polish it into a proper framework and ebook. I'm also building an AI agent and canvas editor to help founders put the framework into practice.

The core idea: not all pivots are created equal. There's a hierarchy — Customer → Problem → Solution → Technology → Growth — and understanding where you are determines how to pivot effectively.

Given it's already resonating with the FI community, would you be open to exploring a more formal integration into the curriculum? Happy to share the draft and demo the tools.

Best,
Selcuk

**Subject:** Pivot framework — fellow W14 alum

Hey Garry,

Hope you're well! It's been a while since W14.

After my second startup Boostable, while I was investing and mentoring at 500 Startups, I developed a mental framework called the **Pivot Pyramid** to help startups think about how to pivot and experiment. It got picked up by VentureBeat and the 500 blog at the time.

Recently, I noticed it's been cited organically in several places — Founders Institute, among others — so I decided to polish it into a proper framework and ebook. I'm also building an AI agent and canvas editor to help founders put it into practice.

The core idea: not all pivots are equal. There's a hierarchy — Customer → Problem → Solution → Technology → Growth — and understanding where you are determines how to pivot effectively.

Would love to share it with you. If it resonates, maybe it could be useful for Startup School or the YC community?

Best,
Selcuk

**Subject:** Pivot framework — would love your take

Hey Brad,

Long time! Hope you've been well.

After my second startup Boostable, while I was investing and mentoring at 500 Startups, I developed a mental framework called the **Pivot Pyramid** to help startups think about how to pivot and experiment. It got picked up by VentureBeat and the 500 blog at the time.

Recently, I noticed it's been cited organically in several places — Founders Institute, among others — so I decided to polish it into a proper framework and ebook.

The core idea: not all pivots are equal. There's a hierarchy — Customer → Problem → Solution → Technology → Growth — and knowing which layer is broken determines everything.

Would love to get your take on it. Happy to share the draft.

**Email:** andrew@a16z.com
**Relationship:** You know him

**Subject:** Pivot framework — side project through the holidays

Hey Andrew,

Hope you're well!

I've been working on something on the side through the holidays that might resonate with your audience.

After my second startup Boostable, while I was investing and mentoring at 500 Startups, I developed a mental framework called the **Pivot Pyramid** to help startups think about how to pivot and experiment. It got picked up by VentureBeat and the 500 blog at the time.

Recently, I noticed it's been cited organically in several places — Founders Institute, among others — so I decided to polish it into a proper framework and ebook. I'm also building an AI agent and canvas editor to help founders put it into practice.

The core idea: pivots aren't random. They follow a hierarchy — Customer → Problem → Solution → Technology → Growth — and understanding where you are determines how expensive and risky your pivot will be.

Given your work on The Cold Start Problem, I think there's natural overlap — especially around the Growth layer pivots.

Would love to share it with you. If it resonates, maybe it could be a fit for your newsletter or a16z content?

Best,
Selcuk

### 5. Greg Isenberg — Late Checkout

**Email:** gregisenberg@gmail.com or greg.isenberg@latecheckout.studio
**Relationship:** You know him

**Subject:** Pivot framework — might be podcast material

Hey Greg,

Hope you're well!

I've been working on something I think your audience would dig.

After my second startup Boostable, while I was investing and mentoring at 500 Startups, I developed a mental framework called the **Pivot Pyramid** to help startups think about how to pivot and experiment. It got picked up by VentureBeat and the 500 blog at the time.

Recently, I noticed it's been cited organically in several places — Founders Institute, among others — so I decided to polish it into a proper framework and ebook. I'm also building an AI agent and canvas editor to help founders put it into practice.

The core idea: pivots follow a hierarchy — Customer → Problem → Solution → Technology → Growth. Most founders pivot randomly. This framework gives them structure.

Given your focus on building internet businesses and community-first products, I think there's a lot of overlap — especially around the Customer and Growth layers.

Would love to share it with you. Could make for an interesting podcast conversation if you're into it.

Best,
Selcuk

### 6. Chris Yeh — Blitzscaling

**Email:** info@blitzscaling.com (general) or via chrisyeh.com
**Relationship:** You know him

**Subject:** Pivot framework that complements Blitzscaling

Hey Chris,

Hope you're well!

I've been working on a framework I think complements your work on Blitzscaling — it's called the **Pivot Pyramid**.

After my second startup Boostable, while I was investing and mentoring at 500 Startups, I developed this mental framework to help startups think about how to pivot and experiment. It got picked up by VentureBeat and the 500 blog at the time.

Recently, I noticed it's been cited organically in several places — Founders Institute, among others — so I decided to polish it into a proper framework and ebook. I'm also building an AI agent and canvas editor to help founders put it into practice.

The core idea: before you can blitzscale, you need to nail your foundation. The Pivot Pyramid provides a structured way to validate (or invalidate) each layer: Customer → Problem → Solution → Technology → Growth.

I think there's a natural narrative arc: **Pivot Pyramid** helps you find product-market fit, then **Blitzscaling** helps you scale it.

Would love to get your thoughts. If it resonates, I'd be honored to have your endorsement — or even explore a foreword.

Best,
Selcuk

### 7. Sarah Stein Greenberg — Stanford d.school

**Email:** sstein@stanford.edu (likely) or via dschool.stanford.edu contact
**Role:** Executive Director, Stanford d.school

**Subject:** Design framework for startup pivots — d.school curriculum idea

Dear Sarah,

I'm Selcuk Atli — a serial founder who started and exited two ad-tech startups, and most recently built Bunch (raised $26M, 10M users). I'm also a YC W14 alum and 500 Startups Venture Partner.

After my second startup Boostable, while I was investing and mentoring at 500, I developed a mental framework called the **Pivot Pyramid** to help startups think about how to pivot and experiment. It got picked up by VentureBeat and the 500 blog at the time.

Recently, I noticed it's been cited organically in several places — Founders Institute, among others — so I decided to polish it into a proper framework and ebook. I'm also building an AI agent and canvas editor to help founders put it into practice.

The Pivot Pyramid applies design thinking principles to startup strategy. It provides a structured hierarchy for understanding business model pivots: Customer → Problem → Solution → Technology → Growth.

Given the d.school's focus on human-centered design and creative problem-solving, I think this framework could complement your curriculum — especially for students tackling entrepreneurial challenges.

I read "Creative Acts for Curious People" and was inspired by your approach to structured creativity. The Pivot Pyramid aims to bring similar structure to the often chaotic process of pivoting a startup.

Would you be open to exploring this? I'd be happy to share the draft and demo the tools.

Best regards,
Selcuk Atli

### 8. Tom Byers — Stanford STVP

**Email:** tbyers@stanford.edu
**Role:** Faculty Director, Stanford Technology Ventures Program

**Subject:** Pivot framework for engineering entrepreneurs — STVP curriculum

Dear Professor Byers,

I'm Selcuk Atli — a serial founder who started and exited two ad-tech startups, and most recently built Bunch (raised $26M, 10M users). I'm also a YC W14 alum and 500 Startups Venture Partner.

After my second startup Boostable, while I was investing and mentoring at 500, I developed a mental framework called the **Pivot Pyramid** to help startups think about how to pivot and experiment. It got picked up by VentureBeat and the 500 blog at the time.

Recently, I noticed it's been cited organically in several places — Founders Institute, among others — so I decided to polish it into a proper framework and ebook. I'm also building an AI agent and canvas editor to help founders put it into practice.

The framework provides a structured approach to startup pivots, organized as a hierarchy: Customer → Problem → Solution → Technology → Growth. It includes diagnostic tools, playbooks for each pivot type, and a cost/impact matrix for decision-making.

Given STVP's focus on principled entrepreneurship and responsible innovation, I think this framework could help engineering students approach the messy process of pivoting with more rigor.

Would you be open to reviewing it? I'd be honored to contribute to STVP in any capacity — guest lecture, curriculum material, or case study.

Best regards,
Selcuk Atli

### 9. Deepak Hegde — NYU Stern / Endless Frontier Labs

**Email:** dh99@stern.nyu.edu
**Role:** Director, Endless Frontier Labs; Berkley Center for Entrepreneurship

---

**Subject:** Pivot framework for science-based startups — EFL curriculum

Dear Professor Hegde,

I'm Selcuk Atli — a serial founder who started and exited two ad-tech startups, and most recently built Bunch (raised $26M, 10M users). I'm also a YC W14 alum and 500 Startups Venture Partner.

After my second startup Boostable, while I was investing and mentoring at 500, I developed a mental framework called the **Pivot Pyramid** to help startups think about how to pivot and experiment. It got picked up by VentureBeat and the 500 blog at the time.

Recently, I noticed it's been cited organically in several places — Founders Institute, among others — so I decided to polish it into a proper framework and ebook. I'm also building an AI agent and canvas editor to help founders put it into practice.

Science and technology startups face unique pivot challenges — especially at the Technology layer. The Pivot Pyramid provides a structured hierarchy (Customer → Problem → Solution → Technology → Growth) with specific playbooks for each type of pivot.

Given EFL's focus on transforming scientific breakthroughs into high-growth businesses, I think this framework could help founders navigate the transition from lab to market more systematically.

Would you be open to exploring this for EFL or the Berkley Center? I'd be happy to share the draft and demo the tools.

Best regards,
Selcuk Atli

### 10. Angela Lee — Columbia Business School

**Email:** awl2108@gsb.columbia.edu
**Role:** Faculty Director, Eugene Lang Entrepreneurship Center; Founder, 37 Angels

---

**Subject:** Pivot framework for Columbia entrepreneurs — Lang Center curriculum

Dear Professor Lee,

I'm Selcuk Atli — a serial founder who started and exited two ad-tech startups, and most recently built Bunch (raised $26M, 10M users). I'm also a YC W14 alum and 500 Startups Venture Partner.

After my second startup Boostable, while I was investing and mentoring at 500, I developed a mental framework called the **Pivot Pyramid** to help startups think about how to pivot and experiment. It got picked up by VentureBeat and the 500 blog at the time.

Recently, I noticed it's been cited organically in several places — Founders Institute, among others — so I decided to polish it into a proper framework and ebook. I'm also building an AI agent and canvas editor to help founders put it into practice.

The framework provides a structured approach to evaluating and executing pivots: Customer → Problem → Solution → Technology → Growth. For investors, it also offers a diagnostic lens for evaluating whether a struggling portfolio company should pivot — and where.

Given your dual perspective as an educator and investor (37 Angels), I think you'd find the framework's approach to pivot cost/benefit analysis particularly interesting.

Would you be open to reviewing it? I'd be honored to contribute to the Lang Center — whether as a guest speaker, curriculum material, or case study.

Best regards,
Selcuk Atli

### 11. Steve Blank — Stanford / Berkeley

**Email:** Via steveblank.com contact form
**Role:** Father of Lean Startup, Stanford/Berkeley lecturer

**Subject:** Pivot framework that builds on Customer Development

Dear Steve,

I'm Selcuk Atli — a serial founder who started and exited two ad-tech startups, and most recently built Bunch (raised $26M, 10M users). I'm also a YC W14 alum and 500 Startups Venture Partner.

Your work on Customer Development fundamentally shaped how I build companies. I've developed a framework called the **Pivot Pyramid** that I believe extends your methodology.

After my second startup Boostable, while I was investing and mentoring at 500, I developed this mental framework to help startups think about how to pivot and experiment. It got picked up by VentureBeat and the 500 blog at the time. Recently, I noticed it's been cited organically in several places — Founders Institute, among others — so I decided to polish it into a proper framework and ebook.

Your work taught us that startups need to "get out of the building" and validate hypotheses. The Pivot Pyramid provides a structured hierarchy for what to do when that validation fails: Customer → Problem → Solution → Technology → Growth.

**Key insight:** Not all pivots are equal. A Customer pivot is fundamentally different (and more expensive) than a Solution pivot. The framework provides playbooks for each type.

I'm also building an AI agent and canvas editor to help founders put it into practice.

Would you be open to reviewing it? Your feedback would be invaluable — and if it resonates, I'd be honored to explore how it might complement Lean LaunchPad.

Best regards,
Selcuk Atli

### 12. Kurt Beyer — UC Berkeley

**Email:** [You likely have this]
**Relationship:** Your former mentor, possibly still Berkeley instructor

---

**Subject:** Pivot framework I've been working on — would love your feedback

Hey Kurt,

Hope you're doing well! It's been too long.

I've been working on something I'd love to get your feedback on.

After Boostable, while I was investing and mentoring at 500 Startups, I developed a mental framework called the **Pivot Pyramid** to help startups think about how to pivot and experiment. It got picked up by VentureBeat and the 500 blog at the time.

Recently, I noticed it's been cited organically in several places — Founders Institute, among others — so I decided to polish it into a proper framework and ebook. I'm also building an AI agent and canvas editor to help founders put it into practice.

The core idea: pivots follow a hierarchy — Customer → Problem → Solution → Technology → Growth — and knowing which layer is broken determines everything.

Given your work with entrepreneurs at Berkeley, I think this could be useful as curriculum material — or at least an interesting read.

Would you be open to taking a look? I'd also love to catch up if you're around.

Best,
Selcuk

### 13. Jason Kuruzovich — RPI Lally School of Business

**Email:** [You likely have this from your Masters]
**Relationship:** Your former professor

---

**Subject:** Pivot framework from a former student — case study material?

Dear Professor Kuruzovich,

I hope this email finds you well. I was your student at Lally School of Business during my Masters, and I've been thinking about you as I've developed something I think could be useful for your entrepreneurship courses.

Since Lally, I've started and exited two ad-tech startups, and most recently built Bunch (raised $26M, 10M users). I'm also a YC W14 alum and 500 Startups Venture Partner.

After my second startup Boostable, while I was investing and mentoring at 500, I developed a mental framework called the **Pivot Pyramid** to help startups think about how to pivot and experiment. It got picked up by VentureBeat and the 500 blog at the time.

Recently, I noticed it's been cited organically in several places — Founders Institute, among others — so I decided to polish it into a proper framework and ebook. I'm also building an AI agent and canvas editor to help founders put it into practice.

The framework organizes pivots into a hierarchy: Customer → Problem → Solution → Technology → Growth.

Would you be interested in reviewing it? I'd be honored if it could be useful for Lally students — as a case study, guest lecture, or course reading.

Best regards,
Selcuk Atli

## Tier 3: IDEO & Design Community

### 14. Michael Peng — IDEO CEO

**Email:** Via LinkedIn or IDEO contact form (michael@ideo.com likely)
**Role:** CEO, IDEO (as of June 2025)

---

**Subject:** Design framework for startup pivots — potential collaboration

Dear Michael,

Congratulations on your appointment as IDEO CEO. Your work co-founding IDEO Tokyo and expanding across Asia is inspiring.

I'm Selcuk Atli — a serial founder who started and exited two ad-tech startups, and most recently built Bunch (raised $26M, 10M users). I'm also a YC W14 alum and 500 Startups Venture Partner.

After my second startup Boostable, while I was investing and mentoring at 500, I developed a mental framework called the **Pivot Pyramid** to help startups think about how to pivot and experiment. It got picked up by VentureBeat and the 500 blog at the time.

Recently, I noticed it's been cited organically in several places — Founders Institute, among others — so I decided to polish it into a proper framework and ebook. I'm also building an AI agent and canvas editor to help founders put it into practice.

The framework applies design thinking principles to startup strategy, providing a structured approach to business model pivots: Customer → Problem → Solution → Technology → Growth.

Given IDEO's focus on human-centered design and your background in venture building at Moon Creative Lab, I think there could be interesting synergies — whether as IDEO U content, client workshop material, or something else.

Would you be open to exploring this?

Best regards,
Selcuk Atli

### 15. Tim Brown — IDEO Chair Emeritus

**Email:** Via LinkedIn or IDEO (tim@ideo.com likely)
**Role:** Chair Emeritus, IDEO; Author of "Change by Design"

---

**Subject:** Framework that applies "Change by Design" to startup pivots

Dear Tim,

I'm Selcuk Atli — a serial founder who started and exited two ad-tech startups, and most recently built Bunch (raised $26M, 10M users). I'm also a YC W14 alum and 500 Startups Venture Partner.

Your book "Change by Design" fundamentally shaped how I think about problem-solving.

After my second startup Boostable, while I was investing and mentoring at 500, I developed a mental framework called the **Pivot Pyramid** to help startups think about how to pivot and experiment. It got picked up by VentureBeat and the 500 blog at the time.

Recently, I noticed it's been cited organically in several places — Founders Institute, among others — so I decided to polish it into a proper framework and ebook. I'm also building an AI agent and canvas editor to help founders put it into practice.

The framework applies design thinking principles to startup strategy. The core insight: pivots follow a hierarchy — Customer → Problem → Solution → Technology → Growth — and each layer requires different design approaches.

I think of it as "Change by Design" for the messy reality of startup pivots — structured creativity when everything is breaking.

Would you be open to reviewing it? Your feedback would be invaluable, and if it resonates, I'd be honored to have your endorsement.

Best regards,
Selcuk Atli

## Tier 4: Thought Leaders (Cold Outreach)

### 16. Eric Ries — Lean Startup

**Email:** Via startuplessonslearned.com/p/contact.html or leanstartup.co
**Role:** Author of "The Lean Startup"; Founder, LTSE

---

**Subject:** Framework that extends the Lean Startup for pivots

Dear Eric,

I'm Selcuk Atli — a serial founder who started and exited two ad-tech startups, and most recently built Bunch (raised $26M, 10M users). I'm also a YC W14 alum and 500 Startups Venture Partner.

"The Lean Startup" changed how I build companies.

After my second startup Boostable, while I was investing and mentoring at 500, I developed a mental framework called the **Pivot Pyramid** to help startups think about how to pivot and experiment. It got picked up by VentureBeat and the 500 blog at the time.

Recently, I noticed it's been cited organically in several places — Founders Institute, among others — so I decided to polish it into a proper framework and ebook. I'm also building an AI agent and canvas editor to help founders put it into practice.

While the Lean Startup teaches us to "pivot or persevere," I've found founders need more structure for the pivot itself.

**The Pivot Pyramid provides:**
- A hierarchy for understanding pivots: Customer → Problem → Solution → Technology → Growth
- Playbooks for each type of pivot
- A cost/impact framework for timing pivots

I'd be honored if you'd review it. Your feedback would help me improve the framework, and if it resonates, I'd love to explore how it might complement your work.

Best regards,
Selcuk Atli
